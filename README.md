# javaee-bootstrap
My bootstrap project for tinkering with JavaEE 7.

It contains:

* JAX-RS Rest endpoint + system-test based on junit
* JPA Entity + integration-test based on arquillian and unit-test based on junit/mockito
* JSF frontend + UI-test based on arquillian+webdriver/graphene

It is set up using JBoss Forge.
